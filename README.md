# 🧠 Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript

Welcome to my **Algorithms & Data Structures (DSA)** repository — a personal collection of classic and advanced algorithms implemented in **JavaScript**.  
This repo reflects my continuous journey of learning, experimenting, and mastering the core principles behind computational logic and problem-solving.

## 🧮 Example Highlight — Dijkstra’s Algorithm

The `Dijkstra/` folder demonstrates how to find the **shortest path** between two nodes in a weighted graph using a **Priority Queue**.  
This forms the base for real-world applications like GPS routing, network optimization, and graph traversal systems.
